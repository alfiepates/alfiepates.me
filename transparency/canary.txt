alfiepates.me warrant canary - April 2016
=========================================

i will endeavor to update this as close as possible to the first of every month, and provide an archive of previous canaries.

each canary will include the date, some news headlines (most likely from the NY Times Europe front page, but also possibly the Independent, the Guardian, or the i), a comment on current affairs, and a declaration that I have (up until that point) not received a request for user information from "a government entity or similar". use your common sense.

each canary will also be signed with my current pgp key, as listed at https://alfiepates.me. please take note if these canaries cease being updated, or canary.txt ceases existence altogether.

As of today, April 1, 2016, I/alfiepates.me has not received a request for user information from a government entity or similar. If I ever receive such a request, I would seek to let the public know it existed.

Today’s NY Times Europe Edition front page:

“Nationalist Serb acquitted of warcrimes”
“Republicans face risks as states push party agenda”
“Saudis turn to ISIS, and turn against their country”

the google mail april fool was terrible.
