alfiepates.me warrant canary - June 2016
=========================================

i will endeavor to update this as close as possible to the first of every month, and provide an archive of previous canaries.

each canary will include the date, some news headlines (most likely from the NY Times Europe front page, but also possibly the Independent, the Guardian, or the i), a comment on current affairs, and a declaration that I have (up until that point) not received a request for user information from "a government entity or similar". use your common sense.

each canary will also be signed with my current pgp key, as listed at https://alfiepates.me. please take note if these canaries cease being updated, or canary.txt ceases existence altogether.

Todayâ€™s NY Times Europe Edition front page:

"Regulators worldwide take aim at tech giants"
"Zimbabwean charts her return to power"
"E.U. chides Poland over shortcoming in rule of law"
